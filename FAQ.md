## Q. Why Windows Defender?
A.    Two reasons, its **free** and it’s **good**. First off let’s make one thing clear, Microsoft wants us to think of Windows Defender as more than just an AV. We should really be calling it by it’s full name, the “Windows Defender Security Center” because it really is a suite of security tools all included within Windows 10. I did some searching around to see if it was an actual choice when it came to antivirus (AV) solutions and was pleasantly surprised to find that it is a perfect contender with other AV solutions and made my decision a no brainer. I used [av-test.org](https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/) and [av-comparatives.org](https://www.av-comparatives.org/consumer/test-results/microsoft-windows/) to come to that conclusion in case you are a skeptic or you just like sources.
