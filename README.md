# CyberDump
This is a collection of information for cyber security beginners or seasoned veterans. Throughout my time at university, I have wanted a collection of sites/books/tutorials all in one place. Obviously this will be just a handful of resources that my peers and I find useful in order to avoid clutter or confusion. I intend for this to be used as a place where you can find additional resources that you might not have used before or never had exposure to.

Happy hacking!
